  <dt>What's this all about?</dt>
  <dd>It's an attempt to answer all the +1's that you see on github issues and try to reward the folks who generously give their time to open source.</dd>

  <dt>When does my card get charged?</dt>
  <dd>Only once the issue is closed and the repository owner designates a winner.</dd>

  <dt>Who decides who gets the money?</dt>
  <dd>That all falls to the repository owner</dd>

  <dt>What if multiple people helped close the issue?</dt>
  <dd>All decisions are left up to the owner of the repository the issue is on. If it's a point of contention, the owner is welcome to designate themselves as the winner and put the money toward future development of the project</dd>

  <dt>How do I get paid?</dt>
  <dd>At the moment, we'll just send you a check. However proper payouts via ACH or Stripe Connect are on the road map if this site grabs traction.</dd>

  <dt>How much are the processing fees?</dt>
  <dd>At the moment we keep 5% + 30 cents of every pledge to cover our processing costs and help keep the site running. We may change this as the site matures.</dd>
